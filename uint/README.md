# Uint

## Description

Provides facilities to construct big unsigned integer types.
Also provides commonly used `U128, U256` and `U512` out of the box.

The focus on the provided big unsigned integer types is performance and cross-platform availability.
Support a very similar API as the built-in primitive integer types.

## Usage

In your `Cargo.toml` paste

```
uint = "0.8"
```

Construct your own big unsigned integer type as follows.

```
// U1024 with 1024 bits consisting of 16 x 64-bit words
construct_uint!(U1024; 16);
```

## Tests
