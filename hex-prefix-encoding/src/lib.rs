use std::iter::once;

/// Hex-prefix Encoding. Encodes a payload and a flag. The high nibble of the first
/// bytes contains the flag; the lowest bit of the flag encodes the oddness of the
/// length and the second-lowest bit encodes whether the node is a value node. The
/// low nibble of the first byte is zero in the case of an even number of nibbles
/// in the payload, otherwise it is set to the first nibble of the payload.
/// All remaining nibbles (now an even number) fit properly into the remaining bytes.
///
/// The "termination marker" and "leaf-node" specifier are equivalent.
///
/// Input nibbles are in range `[0, 0xf]`.
///
/// ```markdown
///  [0,0,1,2,3,4,5]   0x10_01_23_45	// length is odd (7) so the lowest bit of the high nibble of the first byte is `1`; it is not a leaf node, so the second-lowest bit of the high nibble is 0; given it's an odd length, the lower nibble of the first byte is set to the first nibble. All in all we get 0b0001_000 (oddness) + 0b0000_0000 (is leaf?) + 0b0000_0000 = 0b0001_0000 = 0x10 and then we append the other nibbles
///  [0,1,2,3,4,5]     0x00_01_23_45	// length is even (6) and this is not a leaf node so the high nibble of the first byte is 0; the low nibble of the first byte is unused (0)
///  [1,2,3,4,5]       0x11_23_45   	// odd length, not leaf => high nibble of 1st byte is 0b0001 and low nibble of 1st byte is set to the first payload nibble (1) so all in all: 0b00010001, 0x11
///  [0,0,1,2,3,4]     0x00_00_12_34	// even length, not leaf => high nibble is 0 and the low nibble is unused so we get 0x00 and then the payload: 0x00_00_12â€¦
///  [0,1,2,3,4]       0x10_12_34		// odd length, not leaf => oddness flag + first nibble (0) => 0x10
///  [1,2,3,4]         0x00_12_34
///  [0,0,1,2,3,4,5,T] 0x30_01_23_45	// odd length (7), leaf => high nibble of 1st byte is 0b0011; low nibble is set to 1st payload nibble so the first encoded byte is 0b0011_0000, i.e. 0x30
///  [0,0,1,2,3,4,T]   0x20_00_12_34	// even length (6), lead => high nibble of 1st byte is 0b0010; low nibble unused
///  [0,1,2,3,4,5,T]   0x20_01_23_45
///  [1,2,3,4,5,T]     0x31_23_45		// odd length (5), leaf => high nibble of 1st byte is 0b0011; low nibble of 1st byte is set to first payload nibble (1) so the 1st byte becomes 0b0011_0001, i.e. 0x31
