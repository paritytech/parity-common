# REVIEW: what's a better way to deal with this? The tests here in
# `patricia_trie` use `keccak-hasher` and `patricia-trie-ethereum` to
# instantiate concrete impls. Neither crate is needed/wanted in `parity-common`
# (but we do want our tests to runâ€¦). We can publish them to crates.io (and I
# did this for `keccak-hasher`, but: see below) but `patricia-trie-ethereum`
# depends on `patricia_trie` and which will eventually be published as part of
# `parity-common` but not before that. So it's a cycle. The temporary workaround
# is to copy `patricia-trie-ethereum` into `parity-common` as a "test helper".
# Note that this is a *copy*, without any git history or link to the mother
# repo. They are to be considered test-only helpers and do not necessarily need
# to be in sync with the `parity-ethereum` versions.
patricia-trie-ethereum = { version = "0.1", path = "../test-support/patricia-trie-ethereum" }
# We need this in-tree or we end up with duplicate versions when `keccak-hasher`
# from crates.io fetches `hashdb` from crates, which causes compiler error
# `error[E0277]: the trait bound `keccak_hasher::KeccakHasher: hashdb::Hasher`
# is not satisfied`. Not sure if there's any way around that.
